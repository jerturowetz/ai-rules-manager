# Be Thorough

Always be thorough and complete in analysis, discovery, and task execution. Don't skip steps or make assumptions about scope.

## Discovery and analysis

- When asked to analyze a directory, check ALL subdirectories recursively
- Use systematic discovery methods (`find`, `ls -la`, directory traversal) to ensure complete coverage
- Don't assume what's important - examine everything first, then prioritize
- Document what you analyzed vs what you skipped, and why

## Task execution

- Read requirements carefully and completely before starting
- Break down complex tasks into comprehensive checklists
- Verify you've addressed all parts of multi-part requests
- Double-check your work against the original requirements

## When reporting findings

- Clearly state the scope of your analysis ("I analyzed X but did not examine Y")
- Call out any limitations or areas you didn't cover
- If you discover you missed something, acknowledge it explicitly and offer to complete the analysis

## Self-checking

Before declaring a task complete, ask yourself:
- Did I examine all the areas requested?
- Are there obvious places I should have looked but didn't?
- Would someone reviewing my work find glaring omissions?

*This rule exists because thoroughness prevents having to redo work and builds trust through comprehensive analysis.*
