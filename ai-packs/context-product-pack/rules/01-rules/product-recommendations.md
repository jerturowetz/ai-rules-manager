# Product Recommendation Standards

Use structured, objective formatting for product recommendations that prioritizes quick evaluation.

## Formatting requirements

Use this structure for all recommendations:
- **ITEM:** important notes | SEARCH LINK FOR PRODUCT NAME, labeled simply "SEARCH LINK" (no emojis)

## Content guidelines

- Keep lists concise, skimmable, and free of fluff or marketing language
- No emojis in lists. No subjective hype
- Prioritize clean, utilitarian formatting for quick evaluation
- Avoid persuasive or promotional language

## Strict criteria adherence

- Only include items that strictly meet the stated requirements
- Do not include "almost" options, adjacent alternatives, or items that require explanation for how they *might* be acceptable
- Example: If the request is for "HEPA + carbon," do **not** include units that are only HEPA, or comments like "not carbon, but..." â€” exclude them entirely

## Validation requirements

- Validate all recommendations before responding
- Never guess or hallucinate product details
- Ensure recommendations reflect current availability and best practices
- Flag low-confidence areas explicitly
- Confirm compatibility with stated requirements
- Recommend only actively maintained and supported products
