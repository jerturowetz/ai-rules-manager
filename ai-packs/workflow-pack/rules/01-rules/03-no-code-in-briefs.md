# No Code in Briefs

When generating **briefs, task drafts, project overviews, or planning docs**, do not include code examples or implementation details.

## What to avoid

- Code examples, snippets, or implementation details
- Specific syntax or technical implementations
- Opinionated solutions before exploration begins

## What to include instead

- Keep content conceptual, requirements-level, or descriptive only
- Express technical details in plain language, not code
- Focus on the problem and requirements rather than solutions

## Rationale

The purpose is to avoid opinionated solutions before proper exploration and analysis begins. Planning documents should focus on understanding the problem space and requirements, not prescribing specific technical implementations.
