# TODO: Rulebook-AI Integration

## Overview

Current state: We have a rule development workspace that generates packs.
Goal: Integrate with rulebook-ai for centralized pack management and project-specific deployment.

## Integration Architecture

```
ai-rules-manager (this repo)
├── Develop rules in organized structure
├── Generate packs with manifests
└── Publish to centralized registry

rulebook-ai ecosystem
├── Discover available packs from registry
├── Project profiles select which packs to use
└── Deploy selected packs to AI assistants per project
```

## Phase 1: Pack Registry & Discovery

### 1.1 Centralized Pack List
- [ ] Create `pack-registry.json` with metadata for all available packs
- [ ] Include pack descriptions, categories, dependencies, versions
- [ ] Auto-generate registry from pack manifests via script
- [ ] Host registry publicly (GitHub Pages, CDN, or API)

### 1.2 Pack Versioning
- [ ] Add semantic versioning to pack manifests
- [ ] Track rule changes that require pack version bumps
- [ ] Support backwards compatibility in pack structure
- [ ] Enable projects to pin to specific pack versions

## Phase 2: Rulebook-AI Integration

### 2.1 Pack Installation
- [ ] Research rulebook-ai's pack installation mechanism
- [ ] Implement pack installation from our registry
- [ ] Support installing packs by name: `rulebook-ai install foundation-pack`
- [ ] Handle pack dependencies automatically

### 2.2 Project Profiles
- [ ] Create project profiles that specify which packs to use
- [ ] Example: `web-dev-profile` uses `foundation-pack` + `development-standards-pack` + `tech-python-pack`
- [ ] Support profile inheritance and overrides
- [ ] Store profiles as version-controlled configuration

### 2.3 Selective Deployment
- [ ] Deploy only selected packs to AI assistants per project
- [ ] Support different AI assistants getting different pack combinations
- [ ] Handle rule conflicts between packs gracefully
- [ ] Provide dry-run mode for deployment changes

## Phase 3: Enhanced Workflow

### 3.1 Development Workflow Integration
- [ ] `scripts/publish-packs.sh` - Publish updated packs to registry
- [ ] `scripts/update-projects.sh` - Update projects using specific packs
- [ ] CI/CD integration for automatic pack publishing
- [ ] Notification system for pack updates

### 3.2 Community Features
- [ ] Make packs discoverable in rulebook-ai community
- [ ] Support forking and customizing packs
- [ ] Pack rating and usage statistics
- [ ] Documentation generation for pack websites

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Core Integration)
1. **Pack Registry** - Central discovery mechanism
2. **Rulebook-ai installation** - Basic pack installation
3. **Project profiles** - Selective pack activation

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Features)
4. **Versioning system** - Pin to specific versions
5. **Dependency management** - Handle pack relationships
6. **CI/CD automation** - Streamline publishing

### Low Priority (Community Features)
7. **Community sharing** - Public pack ecosystem
8. **Advanced profiles** - Complex inheritance rules
9. **Analytics** - Usage tracking and insights

## Research Needed

- [ ] Study rulebook-ai's current pack system architecture
- [ ] Understand how rulebook-ai discovers and installs packs
- [ ] Identify rulebook-ai's profile/project configuration format
- [ ] Test pack compatibility with different AI assistants
- [ ] Research community pack sharing mechanisms

## Success Metrics

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Can create a new project and activate desired packs in < 2 minutes
- [ ] Pack updates propagate to projects automatically (if desired)
- [ ] Clear visibility into which packs are active in each project

### Maintainability
- [ ] Rule changes automatically generate updated packs
- [ ] Centralized rule development but distributed deployment
- [ ] Version conflicts and dependencies handled gracefully

### Adoption
- [ ] Other developers can easily discover and use our packs
- [ ] Packs work seamlessly across different AI assistants
- [ ] Community contributes additional packs using our structure

## Next Steps

1. **Research Phase**: Study rulebook-ai documentation and codebase
2. **Prototype**: Build basic pack registry and installation
3. **Test**: Deploy to a sample project using rulebook-ai
4. **Iterate**: Refine based on real usage experience
5. **Document**: Create integration guides for other developers
