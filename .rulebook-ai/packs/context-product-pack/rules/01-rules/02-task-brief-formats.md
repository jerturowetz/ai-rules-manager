# Task Brief Formats

Choose between two formats based on task complexity and audience.

## Type 1: Structured task briefs

For multi-disciplinary teams requiring detailed context and planning.

### Format requirements

Start with a short intro paragraph **without a heading** — this should feel like a GitHub readme: plainspoken, context-rich, and immediately informative. Avoid any fluff.

Use clearly labeled section headings to organize content:

1. **Intro paragraph (no heading):**
   - Summarize where the task originated and current scope
   - Mention specific user or business trigger if relevant
   - State the goal or change at a high level

2. **# Why?**
   - Explain why the task matters
   - Provide motivation: recurring pain points, missed opportunities, or business upside
   - Include relevant trends, stakeholder asks, or time-sensitive needs

3. **# Use cases / real examples**
   - Bullet real or hypothetical examples of usage
   - Include links to related tasks, docs, designs, or recorded context
   - Ground the abstract goal in tangible situations

4. **# Requirements**
   - List specific needs for the solution, organized clearly
   - Include design/dev specs, config options, performance needs
   - Call out constraints or dependencies

5. **# Next step**
   - Clarify the immediate action expected
   - For dev tasks: "make an RFC"
   - For design/product/QA: specific evaluation or mockup tasks

### Style requirements

- Clear, intelligent, respectful of reader's time, occasionally funny
- No verbosity, no justification, don't embellish
- Assume assignee is capable and familiar with internal tools
- Avoid corporate speak or over-formality
- Always write for people outside your immediate discipline

### Additional requirements

- Prefer specific examples and real internal links over hypotheticals
- Include at least one screenshot, Figma link, or Loom if UX/UI related
- Keep section headers simple and functional — don't get poetic

## Type 2: Casual task descriptions

For straightforward tasks requiring quick, informal communication.

### Format requirements

Write 1–2 casual, human-sounding paragraphs. Avoid structured headers like "Goals" or "Next Steps" — just lay out the context and what needs doing naturally, like you'd say it in Slack.

### Style requirements

- Direct, thoughtful, and informal without being sloppy
- Assume assignee is smart and doesn't need hand-holding
- Prioritize clarity and tone over formality
- Should be easy to absorb at a glance

### Example

> The product overview page feels pretty clunky when scanned quickly — too much visual weight on secondary stuff, and the key message isn't landing above the fold. Can you take a pass at tightening it up? Not expecting a full redesign, just enough to make the hierarchy feel more intentional.
